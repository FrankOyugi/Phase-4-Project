## Overview
The real estate market in the United States offers a wide range of housing options but thereâ€™s little knowledge on how to value them to guide buyers and sellers.It is therefore a huge advantage to know which properties will provide a substantial Return On Investment(ROI) and which properties will most likely bring losses before making a decision on the property to buy.By using technical machine learning techniques,time seriesmodels can be built and analysed using historical information and thereafter,forecasting can be possible.

## Problem Statement
Housing You Too Ltd, a consultancy and real estate firm, has been approached by a client eager to invest in properties with the goal of achieving the highest possible Return on Investment (ROI). The client is looking for our expert guidance to identify the top 5 zip codes that promise the best ROI. Recognizing the complexity and layered nature of this question, we are committed to providing a thorough and data-driven analysis. To achieve this, we will utilize the extensive Zillow dataset, which contains historical real estate data. By analyzing trends, property values, and other key metrics, we aim to deliver the most accurate and insightful recommendations to guide our client's investment decisions for maximum profitability.

## Objectives
- Identify the 5 best zip codes that will bring our clients the highest ROI.

- Build a time series regression model in order to predict the 5 most profitable zip codes.

- Using the dataset and the model created investigate the growth rate of the real estate industry in relation to sales value of properties.

- Identify the 5 worst zip codes that our client should avoid in order to prevent incurring losses.

## Challenges
- Data Ambiguity and Unpredictability: Since we are using real-world data, there is a possibility of ambiguity and unpredictability, which can lead to some inaccuracies in our analysis and predictions.

- Changing Market Conditions: Real estate markets are influenced by various external factors such as economic shifts, policy changes, and unforeseen events like natural disasters or pandemics. These factors can alter market conditions rapidly, making historical data less reliable for future predictions.

## Solutions
- We will implement robust data cleaning and preprocessing techniques to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. We will also use advanced statistical methods and machine learning algorithms that can manage noisy data and enhance prediction accuracy.

- Integrate real-time data sources and economic indicators into the analysis to account for current market conditions. Use adaptive models that can update predictions based on the latest data.
